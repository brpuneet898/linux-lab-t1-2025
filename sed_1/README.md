# SED Challenge: Reverse Words on Every Third Line

## Problem Statement

You are given a text file. Your task is to **reverse the order of words** on **every third line** of the file (i.e., line 3, 6, 9, etc.). All other lines should remain unchanged.

- Words are space-separated.
- The line itself should NOT be reversed â€” only the order of words should change.
- Punctuation is part of the word (do not treat it specially).
- Empty lines are counted in the line number.

## Example

**Input File**
```
Hello world
This is line two
one two three four
Keep this line as-is
Another one here
a b c d e
```

**Output File**
```
Hello world
This is line two
four three two one
Keep this line as-is
Another one here
e d c b a
```

## Constraints

- Use only `sed` for processing (POSIX or GNU `sed`).
- No use of `awk`, `perl`, or other tools.
- You may use `bash` scripting to assist `sed` in `solution.sh`.
